            Ji Wang is an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, College of Physical Science and Technology, Central China Normal University, China. He received the B.S. degree from the School of Electronic Information and Communications, <a href="https://www.hust.edu.cn/">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Information and Communications Engineering, <a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, China, in 2013. He held postdoctoral positions with the School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and the Department of Electrical Engineering, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, USA. His research interests include 5G/6G networks and machine learning.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" class="note">
            After joining Central China Normal University in November 2019, Dr Wang founded the "Wireless Intelligent Connectivity Innovation Lab" and led the team to engage in research and development in the fields of new multi-antenna communication technology, space-ground integrated information network, and intelligent communication. In recent years, He have conducted in-depth research on the basic theory, architecture, and implementation of mobile communications to meet the major needs of the subsequent evolution of the beyond fifth generation of mobile communications ("B5G") and the sixth generation of mobile communications ("6G"), and have been committed to promoting the application of optimization theory and artificial intelligence in the field of mobile communications.
